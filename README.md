# Text-Encode-Decode
The objective of my project is to encode and decode messages using a common key. The project is built using Tkinter and base64 library. In current project, users have to enter the message to encode or decode. Users have to select the mode to choose the encoding and decoding process. The same key must be used to process the encoding and decoding for the same message.
